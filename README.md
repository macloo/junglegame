Jungle Game (Python 2.7)
========================

A simple text-only Python game based on exercise 45 in Zed Shaw's free online book [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

This exercise is supposed to teach us (beginners) more about object-oriented programming concepts. In a previous exercise, we started building a game with skeleton classes provided by Zed. This time, we start from scratch and design our own text game (like Zork or Adventure). 

In ex. 43, everything was coded in a single .py file. Now, in ex. 45, we are tasked with using multiple files (modules). 

## Current Status

At this point, most things do not run yet. However, you can step through a few locations, and nothing throws an error. 


## Game History

Feb. 4, 2014 - Started the exercise. Drew game map on paper. Listed all items and locations to be used in game. Thought up puzzles and how to solve them.

Feb. 6 - Coded skeleton classes for all game locations. Made a dictionary (map) for all game locations. Made Engine class to run the game. 

Feb. 7 - Created skeleton classes for all game items. These are things that can be picked up, carried, and used. First commit to GitHub.
